The script is one possible solution of the following exercise: 

6. Next Happy Year
You're saying good-bye your best friend, "See you next happy year". 
Happy Year is the year with only distinct digits, (e.g) 2018. 
Write a program that receives an integer number and finds 
the next happy year.

Examples
Input 	Output
8989 	9012
1001 	1023

There were two attempts to solve the exercise. At first there were used 
two for cycles to check for the number on each index if it's the same as another 
number. 
It was latter found that the "set" function might be applicable in that case and 
make the code much shorter. 
The shorter solution is in this folder, but the previous one is accessible 
as well.
