Solution of the following exercise: 

Point
Create a class called Point. Upon initialization it should receive x and y (numbers). Create 3 instance methods:
set_x(new_x) - changes the x value of the point
set_y(new_y) - changes the y value of the point
distance(x, y) - returns the distance between the point and the provided coordinates
Examples
Test Code	
p = Point(2, 4)
p.set_x(3)
p.set_y(5)
print(p.distance(10, 2))	

Output
7.615773105863909
