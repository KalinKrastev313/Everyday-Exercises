The following program aims to print a quadrat from just asterisks. 
It receives input from the type int once, which represents the lenght of a side. 

The script goes as it follows: 
- First, the upper side is printed. 
- Then a for cycle is created which prints two "*" with enough 
intervals between them. This creates the left and the right side. 
The cycle runs (sidelenght - 2) time, because the upper and the lower 
side are printed before or after the cycle. 
- The lower side is printed. 

As there is distanse between the printed rows, " " are added wherever
it is needed, to make the printed figure more even.
