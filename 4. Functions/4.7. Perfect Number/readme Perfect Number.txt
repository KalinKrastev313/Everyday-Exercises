The script is one possible solution of the following exercise: 

7. Perfect Number
Write a function that receives an integer number and returns if this number is perfect or NOT.
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. That is the sum of its
positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).

Examples
Input 		Output 				Comments
6 		We have a perfect number! 	1 + 2 + 3
28 		We have a perfect number! 	1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
1236498 	It's not so perfect.

Hint
Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) => 6 is a
perfect number, because it is the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 (all of which are divided without residue).
