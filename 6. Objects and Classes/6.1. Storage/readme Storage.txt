The script is one possible solution of the following exercise: 

1. Storage
Create a class Storage. The __init__ method should accept one parameter: the capacity of the storage. The
Storage class should also have an attribute called storage, where all the items will be stored. The class should have
two additional methods:
 add_product(product) - adds the product in the storage if there is space for it
 get_products() - returns the storage list
Example

Test Code Output

storage = Storage(4)
storage.add_product("apple";)
storage.add_product("banana")
storage.add_product("potato")
storage.add_product("tomato")
storage.add_product("bread")
print(storage.get_products())

['apple', 'banana', 'potato', 'tomato']
